Hello, I'm Samar!

I'm currently pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science at UC San Diego, with a focus in AI and NLP. Previously I graduated from the University of Central Florida with a bachelor's degree (B.S.) in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.

I'm currently seeking internships for Summer 2026, please feel free to reach out if you are interested!


Experience
======
## AI Engineer Intern
**Soar Tech** — *Orlando, FL*  
*June 2025 – September 2025*

- Fine-tuned three ModernBERT models via Hugging Face Transformers for NER tasks, improving extraction accuracy for domain-specific entities
- Utilized Docling to extract unstructured text from PDFs and convert it into structured, machine-readable formats for downstream processing
- Developed data pipelines leveraging the OpenAI API to extract and structure 60,000+ data points from unstructured PDFs for ModernBERT NER fine-tuning
- Integrated fine-tuned ModernBERT models into a backend system using FastAPI and PostgreSQL, enabling scalable inference and seamless data storage and retrieval

## Undergraduate Research Assistant
**Sage Lab, University of Central Florida** — *Orlando, FL*  
*March 2024 – August 2025*

- Worked on an accessibility research project using AI to identify accessibility issues in UI/UX design and utilized GitHub and Stack Overflow APIs to generate labels
- Developed a ground truth dataset using over 70,000 JSON metadata files and JPEG images to help AI models predict accessibility issues in the underlying UI
- Processed images for text size, text contrast, and image contrast to support ground truth dataset creation
- Utilized Python, OpenCV, scikit-learn, Google OCR, and Pillow

Projects
======
## Mario RL Agent  
**Python, PyTorch**  
*November 2025 - December 2025*

- Developed a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent to play Super Mario, including environment preprocessing and discrete action-space design
- Tuned reward shaping and hyperparameters to improve training stability, convergence, and level completion performance

## Lady Bug  
**Python, Flask, MongoDB**  
*August 2024 – May 2025*

- Enhanced bug localization accuracy through a GitHub bot utilizing bug report and source code embeddings augmented with user interface data (novel approach), achieving a 10% relative improvement in bug finding
- Led database development using MongoDB to store embeddings and associated metadata
- Advanced research outcomes by experimenting with 5+ frontier LLMs, resulting in a 15% increase over the previous methodology
- Awarded a $250 scholarship, Judge’s Choice Award at the Student Research Symposium, selected as a college-wide showcase finalist, and accepted to the ICSME 2025 conference in Auckland, New Zealand

## Focus Flow  
**Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Firebase**  
*August 2023 – December 2023*
